# Milestone 1: 

In a MERN stack application, login and sign-up (authentication) typically involve a process where users can register (sign-up) with their credentials, and later log in using those credentials. The login and sign-up process can be divided into several steps, with separate client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js/Express) handling.

# Milestone 2:
In this milestone, we focused on structuring our E-Commerce application and developing the Login Page as the first user-facing feature. The process involved several key steps, ensuring a solid foundation for both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express).
## Milestone 3: Backend Setup

### Progress:
- Set up the project folder structure with routes, controllers, models, middlewares, and utilities.
- Created a Node.js server with Express.
- Connected the server to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Added error handling middleware for better debugging.
- 

## Milestone 4 Overview

### In this milestone, the following features were implemented:

- User Model Creation: A new User model was created to represent user data in the database, including necessary fields such as name, email, password, etc.
- Multer Integration: Multer was integrated to handle file uploads (e.g., profile images, documents, etc.). Multer handles multipart/form-data, which is used for uploading files in Node.js applications.



## Milestone 5: Sign-Up Page Implementation

In this milestone, I have created a Sign-Up page with the following features:
- A user-friendly form for entering Name, **Email, **Password, and **Confirm Password.
- Form validation to ensure:
  - All fields are filled.
  - The email is valid.
  - The password meets the minimum length requirement and matches the confirm password field.
- Upon successful form submission, the user is redirected to the Login page.

Technologies used:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

## Milestone 6: Backend endpoint for the Signup page to store all user data securely

In this milestone, I have implemented User Authentication for the backend with the following features:

- Password Encryption
- User Signup via Endpoint
- Tested Endpoints Using Postman GET & POST Requests

Technologies Used:
- MongoDB & Mongoose (Database & ORM)
- bcrypt.js (Password encryption)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT) (Authentication)


## Milestone 7: Backend endpoint for the Login page to store all user data securely and Implementation

In this milestone, we focus on creating a login endpoint for user authentication. This includes:

- Accepting User Credentials
- Password Hashing
- Compare Hashed Passwords
- Credentials Store in Database (MongoDB)

Technologies Used:
- MongoDB & Mongoose (Database & ORM)
- bcrypt.js (Password encryption)
## Milestone 8:Card Componenet & Homepage Layout
In this milestone, we focused on creating a Card Component and Homepage Layout. This Includes:
Resusable Product card Component
Responsive Grid Layout
Tailwind CSS Styling for Home Page

## Milestone 9: Product Management Frontend
In this milestone we focused on Interacting with product API, Where users can add and view products in a simple UI, This Includes:
Display a form to add products
Form to add a new product
Connects to Express & MongoDB API

## Milestone 10: Product API
In this milestone, We focused on Validation and Store Product Details Using Express and MongoDB API Using Mongoose Library
Create a Product with name, descriptions, price and Image URL
Validates input before storing data in MongoDB
RESTful POST endpoint to add products

# Milestone 11: Dynamic Home Page

## Welcome to Milestone 11! 🌟

Today, we will make our home page that will display all the products dynamic. We will write an endpoint that will send all the data that was saved in MongoDB using the add products page earlier.

### Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:
- Understand how to write an endpoint that will extract and send data from MongoDB.
- Learn how to receive data at the frontend.
- Learn how to display that data dynamically using the product card component created earlier.

# Milestone 12: My Products Page

## Overview
In this milestone, we created a "My Products" page that displays all the products added by the user, filtered by their email.

## Features
- **Backend**: Added an endpoint to fetch products by user email.

- Validated User based on the email provided in the request and retrieved their cart items.

- Displayed Cart Products with details such as quantity, price, product name, and image on the cart page.

## Milestone 19: Cart Page Implementaion
